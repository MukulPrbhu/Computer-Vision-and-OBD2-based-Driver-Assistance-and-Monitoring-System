# Computer-Vision-and-OBD2-based-Driver-Assistance-and-Monitoring-System
The increasing number of Automobiles on the road has made keeping up with the Road Safety
Standards a challenge, for both, the Commuters and the Authorities. The Commuters face the
challenge of keeping track of Traffic Signs, Lanes, other vehicles and much more
simultaneously. At the same time, the authorities face the challenge of ensuring the
implementation of the Traffic Rules and adherence to the same. This can be concluded from the
turn out of the numbers of Road Accidents. Hence, we propose an easy-to-implement solution
which caters to the needs of both sides.<br><br>
A robust Computer Vision based system which keeps tabs of all the Traffic Signs continuously
for driver assistance, bridging the gap between current Automobiles and Intelligent Automotive.
The solution also comprises of a Driving Behaviour analysis method based on On-Board
Diagnostics (OBD) information based on which the Vehicle State can be tracked. Thereby
making it easier for the driver as there would be one less thing to worry about, And at the same
time the log of Vehicle State would make it easier for the authorities to ensure adherence to
Traffic Rules.
